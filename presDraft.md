## any planning on day one

- Ran through trello
- Set up git for everyone, gitlord for Brittany, peasant for rest
- Discussed workflow: git, order of commit, push, rebase, resolving conflicts
- Separated into groups of 2 and 3, utilised slack chat to communicate tasks being worked on, files being edited to avoid conflicting coding

## did you use trello? did it help?

- We primarily delegated work based on a copy of trello worklist, by using labels, we can easily visualize which team member is doing what task. We also re-ordered the tasks so that the same group will be working on tasks that expands existing functions they have worked on.

## did you use git? did it help?
- It was a great opportunity to simulate working in a coding practice, where there will be multiple devs working on shared files. It was a steep learning curve to resolve conflicts when files were clashing, but it also provided us with valuable learning experience to deal with such conflicts.

## what else worked well with your team?
- Being consistent with communication helped in keeping all of us updated. We would conduct multiple daily checkins to understand at what point everyone was at while coding.

## what were the challenges
- Struggling with git rebases, there have been multiple instances where git would not recognize? the differences between our code, and overwrites without any prompt that asks for approving changes.
- Implementing multiple features and functions at a time would result in them clashing, which had us spent extra time refactoring code when each of them would work on its own.
